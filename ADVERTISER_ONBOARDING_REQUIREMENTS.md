# 📋 Advertiser Onboarding - Data Requirements

## 3 Ways to Share Your Transaction Data:

### 1️⃣ **API Integration** (Best - Fully Automated)
- Provide us with your API endpoint for transaction data + authentication credentials
- We'll pull data automatically (daily or real-time)

### 2️⃣ **Google Sheets** (Easy - Semi-Automated)  
- Create a Google Sheet with your transaction data
- Grant edit access to: `hello@growthnity.com`
- We'll read from it


### 3️⃣ **Looker Studio + Google Sheets** (Hybrid)
- Share your Looker Studio dashboard backed by a Google Sheet
- Grant us read access to the underlying Google Sheet
- We'll pull data from the sheet (not the dashboard)
